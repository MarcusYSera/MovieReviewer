look at model.js and change schema to match the fields you see on the wireframe

when doing update functions - > refer back to the mainController and change the req.body fields accordingly

angular - look at app-routing module first
make sure routes are not overridden by express and http Service routes.
(express routes take priority) -- if they do override, you will see your angular side not load on the browser.

every.html>every.component>httpService>routes>maincontroller -db
html - actually display objects / initialize your functions for forms / routing
component - create objects / functions to use on html
service - will help the functions on component by communicating with routes
routes - will communicate with maincontroller
maincontroller - will actually run the db queries.

on deployment - > stop servers first
delete .git in public folder
delete .gitignore in public folder
on macs -> you can use command shift .   to find hidden files/folders
on windows -> find the folder view options and enable hidden files to be seen
make the gitignore on the same level as the server.js file.

when making ec2 instance look for 
Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type 
on security groups
add rule - > type 8000
add rule -> type 27017

When you get to Part 8:
go to the documentation website
get the GPG key
click on 16.04 (Xenial)
use that one

use the red command instead of step 4.

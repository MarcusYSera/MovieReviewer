For a red belt:
CRUD operations all working
Able to create new movies
All movies are displayed upon visiting the website
User may choose to read the reviews of a particular movie
Able to add reviews for each movie
Able to delete each movie
Routing
Root route redirects to '/movies' to display all the movies
Route ‘movies/new’ displays the form to create a new movie
Successful creation and cancel redirect to the root route
Route ‘/movies/:id’ displays the reviews of a particular movie and the delete button
Route ‘/movies/:id/review’ displays the form to add a review for a particular movie
Successful submission or clicking cancel redirects to the movie's reviews page
Backend validations
All movies must have a title of at least 3 characters
Upon creating a movie, a review must be provided
Reviews must have the name of the reviewer, a star rating, and content
A reviewer's name must be at least 3 characters
A review's star rating must be between 1 and 5 stars
The content of a review must be at least 3 characters
Error messages inform the user if a movie or review is not meeting requirements
Error messages are custom-written (not the mongoose default messages)
HTML and CSS reflect the wireframe to at least 75% accuracy






For a black belt:
Deployed, and not on Heroku
ALL of the following four features:
Provide an extra column in the table on the root route to display the calculated average star rating for each movie based on its reviews
Rather than route to '/movies/new' to display the form to create a new movie, have the form nested within the component displayed at '/movies' when needed
Implement Angular front end validations when creating a new review
Errors should pop up as they are generated
Disable the submit button until the form passes all validations
Do this in addition to backend validations, front end validations do not replace backend validations
On the route '/movies/:id', include a Delete button for each review, which removes the review from the database and from the view. Do not redirect to a different route, the user should stay on '/movies/:id'.
Also:
Create a short video walking through the features of your app. Show your validations working. There is no need to speak or show your code.
Remove your github repo after deploying.

Don’t worry about:
What the prompts are asking for. Just ask if you are unsure about what the goals are!
